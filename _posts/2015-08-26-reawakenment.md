Well, it's been a *very* long time since my last post on here and I've decided I'm going to keep these a bit less rambly when there's actually not much to say...

I am now studying mechatronics at UC in Christchurch, NZ. It's a hell of a lot more work than I anticipated, but in a way that's welcome - no more cruising/idling for me! The programme is, for the most part, super interesting and a lot of fun!

I have left Auckland City Brass, unsurprisingly since I am no longer living in Auckland, and am missing the joy of music... Not so much the two hours of 99% tedium on a Monday evening! Really should get back on the trumpet...

I'll soon post about some other stuff I've been doing that's actually relevant and interesting, and I swear I will sort out the ghastly nightmare of brute force JS and mangled CSS that is this website.
