As my first year of study in engineering nears its end, I am approaching a fairly critical decision in the continuation of my degree: what engineering field should I specialise in? In my case, it is not an obvious decision - my initial motivation behind switching to engineering was to have a shot at more "applied" physics, in the form of Engineering Science ("engsci"). 

Looking into this in more depth, however, it seems that engsci is actually a largely mathematical degree, primarily focussed on business efficiency, rather than any physical problems. I do not find lone mathematics particularly interesting - only when it has applications in the real world, is mathematics particularly riveting to me. (That's not to say I don't see the value in pure maths... But it's not a great interest -or strength - of mine.)

With this in mind, and after inspecting my *other* options, it seems that the two fields that most interest me are Mechatronic Engineering, and Computer Systems Engineering. Unlike engsci, which is only available at the University of Auckland (who have more applicants than they know what to do with), both of those specialisations are also available at the University of Canterbury, who have offered me a place for next year.

This is exciting in two ways... Firstly, I get to study at one of NZ's top universities, which is something I have somewhat missed for the past year. Secondly, I get to move to a new city. I have lived my entire life in Auckland, so a fresh start is welcome!

Onwards...
