Hi there! You seem to have stumbled across my diminuitive corner of the web. My name is Richard, and I'm a software engineer and general tinkerer from Auckland, New Zealand, and currently based out of Sydney, Australia. My day job is as a "DevOps Engineer", which refers to my heavy involvement in developing CI/CD automation and general support and mentoring of developers on the "DevOps mindset". My night job (aka "how I burn most of my free time") consists primarily of tinkering with technology of many kinds.

Check out the projects I've written about on here for more specifics, but I love to make things in my life easier by making stuff (both software and physical). Mostly this applies to stuff on my various computation implements (laptop, smartphone, PC), but sometimes also things around the house (oooh yeah, IoT!) Have not yet found a way of automating the family dog on his evening walk, but I continue to seek advice on the matter.

I own a ludicrously large assortment of drone components (including something like five mostly-built drones), and have three 3D printers and counting (each has a specialty!) I have many potentially fearsome plans for these things going forward - will be sure to write about them on my blog so the CAA can admire my law-abiding nature.

Anyway, thanks for visiting! If you came here through a Google search or something, I hope you found what you were looking for. If you have any questions or just want to say hi, feel free to email me on richard [at] hofman.co.nz!
